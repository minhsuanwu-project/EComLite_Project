# Configuration Management Repository Review and Living CM Report

You are a Senior Software Configuration Manager reviewing this software engineering repository.

Your responsibility is to evaluate the repository as it ACTUALLY EXISTS and maintain its Configuration Management Report as a living engineering artifact throughout the semester.

## Critical Rules

1. Inspect the repository before writing or modifying the report.

2. Do NOT invent workflows, branches, pull requests, tests, releases, tags, CI/CD pipelines, configuration items, baselines, or other artifacts.

3. Only state that a practice is "implemented" when repository evidence confirms that it actually exists.

4. Clearly distinguish among:

   - IMPLEMENTED — verified in the repository
   - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED — some supporting evidence exists
   - PLANNED / RECOMMENDED — not currently implemented

5. Do not describe a recommended practice as though the project already uses it.

6. Base all conclusions on repository evidence whenever possible.

# Step 1 — Inspect the Repository

Review the repository for evidence of:

- repository organization
- version control maturity
- commit practices
- branching strategy
- pull requests and merge practices
- change control
- configuration items (CIs)
- baselines
- versioning and tags
- GitHub Releases
- CI/CD
- GitHub Actions
- automated testing
- dependency management
- environment/configuration files
- secrets management
- documentation
- requirements and architecture documentation
- traceability
- rollback/recovery practices
- technical debt
- configuration-management risks

Also inspect, when present:

- README.md
- docs/
- .github/
- .github/workflows/
- tests/
- requirements.txt
- package.json
- pom.xml
- Dockerfile
- docker-compose.yml
- .gitignore
- environment/configuration templates
- release notes
- CHANGELOG.md

---

# Step 2 — Locate the Existing CM Report

Search the repository for an existing Configuration Management Report.

Possible names include:

- CONFIGURATION_MANAGEMENT_REPORT.md
- Configuration_Management_Report.md
- docs/CONFIGURATION_MANAGEMENT_REPORT.md
- similar clearly identifiable CM report files

## If a CM Report already exists

DO NOT create a duplicate report.

Instead:

1. Read the existing report.
2. Compare every major claim against the current repository.
3. Preserve accurate existing material.
4. Correct statements that are no longer accurate.
5. Add newly implemented CM practices.
6. Identify previously recommended practices that have now been implemented.
7. Keep recommendations that are still relevant.
8. Remove or revise obsolete recommendations.
9. Update repository metrics where evidence is available.
10. Increment the report version.

Maintain a Document Revision History near the beginning of the report.

Example:

| Version | Date | Summary of Changes |
|---|---|---|
| 1.0 | 2026-06-01 | Initial CM report |
| 1.1 | 2026-06-15 | Added CI workflow and testing evidence |
| 1.2 | 2026-06-29 | Added release tagging and branch protection |

Do not invent previous revision dates or history. Preserve existing history when available.

## If no CM Report exists

Create:

`docs/CONFIGURATION_MANAGEMENT_REPORT.md`

unless the repository already uses another obvious location for engineering documentation.

Start the report at Version 1.0.

---

# Step 3 — Maintain the CM Report

The report should contain, where supported by repository evidence:

1. Executive Assessment
2. Repository and Version Control Environment
3. Repository Structure
4. Configuration Items
5. Branching Strategy
6. Change Control Process
7. Baseline Management
8. Testing and Quality Gates
9. CI/CD and Automation
10. Release and Version Management
11. Dependency and Environment Management
12. Traceability and Audit Trail
13. Configuration Management Risks
14. Technical Debt
15. Current Repository Maturity Assessment
16. Missing or Partially Implemented CM Artifacts
17. Recommended Next Improvements
18. Document Revision History

Use specific repository evidence such as file paths, workflow names, branches, tags, tests, and releases when available.

---

# Step 4 — Repository Maturity Assessment

Evaluate the current repository maturity in these areas:

| Area | Status | Evidence | Recommended Improvement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Version Control | | | |
| Branching | | | |
| Change Control | | | |
| Configuration Items | | | |
| Baselines | | | |
| Testing | | | |
| CI/CD | | | |
| Release Management | | | |
| Documentation | | | |
| Traceability | | | |
| Risk Management | | | |

Use:

- IMPLEMENTED
- PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- NOT IMPLEMENTED

Do not award maturity based solely on statements in the existing CM report. Verify against repository evidence.

---

# Step 5 — Recommend the Next Repository Improvements

Generate a prioritized list of recommended engineering improvements.

Separate them into:

## High Priority
Items that materially improve software quality, configuration control, testing, reproducibility, or repository integrity.

## Medium Priority
Items that improve engineering maturity and maintainability.

## Future Improvements
Practices appropriate as the project becomes more mature.

For each recommendation explain:

- what should be added or changed
- why it matters
- which repository artifact would be affected

Do NOT automatically implement major changes to application behavior.

---

# Step 6 — Recommended Next Commits

Generate several small, logical next commits rather than one large change.

Example:

Commit 1:
`docs: update CM report to reflect current repository state`

Commit 2:
`ci: add automated test workflow`

Commit 3:
`test: add regression tests for critical functionality`

Commit 4:
`docs: add release and baseline documentation`

Commit 5:
`chore: prepare v1.0.0 release`

Only recommend commits appropriate to the repository's actual current state.

---

# Step 7 — Update the Repository

Update the existing CM Report in place.

If no report exists, create it as described above.

Do NOT delete useful historical information.

Do NOT create duplicate CM reports.

Do NOT falsely document recommended practices as implemented practices.

After updating the report, provide a concise summary containing:

1. CM Report version before this review
2. CM Report version after this review
3. Repository evidence newly incorporated
4. Claims corrected or reclassified
5. Important missing artifacts
6. Recommended next commits

The final CM Report must represent the CURRENT STATE of the repository, not the desired future state.
